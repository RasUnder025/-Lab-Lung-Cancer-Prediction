# -Lab-Lung-Cancer-Prediction

Lung cancer prediction project for college project using Machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine SVM
Random Forest Tree

### We obtain the accuracy and performance measures of each model.

The purpose being to select the best model, and diagnose patients for lung cancer.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RasUnder025/-Lab-Lung-Cancer-Prediction.git
```

Take heed for the filepath, Open using Jupyter notebook and Run.

## Technology used:

1. python (ver. 3.6.1)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. git

## Libraries/Modules used:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. plotly
6. imblearn
7. sklearn

## Dataset features/demographic:

</ul>

## Result

Among the three models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy of 95%, followed by SVM with 93%, and Logistic Regression with 82%.
The Random Forest model is the most effective for this dataset, offering the best balance between precision, recall, and accuracy.
